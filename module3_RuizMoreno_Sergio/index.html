        <p id="story1">Donut Delights was started in 1971 by Melvin Furballski&#44; an immigrant baker from the far east coast of Poland&#46; Known far and wide for his delicate pastries&#44; Melvin fled his homeland in search of a better life for his family&#46; In 1970 he landed in New York City and by chance he found an open seat on a bus heading west&#46;</p>

           <p id="story2">When an unexpected mechanical failure forced a three day delay in Champaign&#44; Illinois&#44; Furballski saw the need for a donut shop&#44; so he decided to stay and make a new life for himself in Urbana&#44; Illinois&#46; With only one hundred dollars to his name&#46; he found an abandoned breadshop and within two days he had one of a kind donuts flying off the racks faster than he could bake them and things have never slowed down&#46; Now you can find that same great donut recipe plus dozens more still being made with the same love and care as when Donut Delights first opened&#46;</p>
